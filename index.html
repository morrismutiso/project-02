            <p>The photos displayed above describe almost my life cycle.
                I majorly spent most of my time on my machine, doing various activities.
                Again a spent time too taking a walk on beautiful sceneries, watching and
                enjoying each and every good aspect of it.
                I take some to travel to distant places to have that different view every time.
                Finally, I take some time to be with the rest of my family members, have a coffe-
                talk together, and whereby i find it encouraging and motivating.
